HashSet: is the best-performing implementation and is a widely-used Set implementation. 
It represents the core characteristics of sets: no duplication and unordered.

LinkedHashSet: This implementation orders its elements based on insertion order. 
So consider using a LinkedHashSet when you want to store unique elements in order.

TreeSet: This implementation orders its elements based on their values, either by their natural ordering, 
or by a Comparator provided at creation time.
