Static variables belong to a class and not to any individual instance. 
The concept of serialization is concerned with the object’s current state. 
Only data associated with a specific instance of a class is serialized, therefore static member fields  are ignored during serialization.


While serialization if you don’t want to save state of a variable. You have to mark that variable as Transient. 
Environment will know that this variable should be ignored and will not save the value of same.



Static variables value can be stored while serializing if the same is provided while initialization.
If variable is defined as Static and Transient both, than static modifier will govern the behavior of variable and not Transient.
